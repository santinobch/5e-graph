# Subclasses

Artificer: Artillerist (Was choosen in the DnD beyond data as the most played)

Barbarian: Totem Warrior (Well stablished as the most played)

Bard: College of Lore (Tied with elloquence, choosed Lore because is older appearance in the PHB)

Cleric: Life Domain (DnD beyond data, ignoring twilight & peace due to they appearing on Tasha's and they being banned on more than one table i play in)

Druid: Circle of the Moon (Highest on dnd beyond data and )

Fighter: Battle Master (Just going by vibes here, im not including echo knight, that subclass is broken, not representative of any other fighter subclass)

Monk: Way of the Open Hand (Highest rated in dnd beyond data)

Paladin: Oath of Vengance (highest rated on dnd beyond data & reddit data)

Ranger: Gloom Stalker (According to dnd bayond data Hunter was the most played subclass, according to reddit data this subclass is bad as fuck, the highest rated subclass by reddit was Gloom Stalker. )

Rogue: Swashbuckler (Dnd beyond data second subclass, pretty high too in the reddit data)

Sorcerer: Dragonic Magic (Dnd beyond data highest)

Warlock: Hexblade (source: common sense)

Wizard: Bladesong (Wasn't esxpecting this one, but that's what the dnd beyond data says)

# Interactive Values

- Turns: the ammount of turns elapsed, increasing this number sums up the damage of all turns elapsed.
- Rolls: Ammount of d20s rolled per attack (advantage = 2).
- Sides on a d20 that crit (see Hexblade)

# What this graph does and does not

- Shows the average damage of all base classes
- Shows the average damage of the most played/representative subclass of each class
- Uses stantandard point buy for all builds
- Does not pick any feat for any build

# Variables taken into account

- As the character levels up `CR` increases and so does the `AC` and `Saving Throws` of the creatures.
- Damage resistances of creatures across `CR`.
- As the character levels up they get stronger via `ASIs` (increased scores).
- As the character levels up they may adquire magical items:
  - Items that add +X to your hit and damage.
  - Items that make your spell DC higher

# Scenario

The scenario is one in which the PCs use all their resources at one time, such as: spells slots, Ki, Action Surge, etc... They don't have time to prepare a proper strategy other than only dealing damage.

*No graph takes into account surprise rounds.*

# Limitations of this analisys

Obviuslly not in all combats the most eficient thing is to only deal damage, for example if you have a druid and another caster in your party you can do `Entangle` + `Stinking Cloud` which can win you the encounter while dealing 0 damage.

# Default score numbers
